## Contracts


Three smart contracts were created using Solidity and the Remix IDE. These were deployed to the blockchain on the Ropsten test network using Ganache and Metamask.



* **Contract One** is the `AssociateProfitSplitter` contract. This divides Ether evenly among associate level employees and allows HR to pay employees efficiently.

* **Contract Two** is the `TieredProfitSplitter` contract.  This distributes different percentages of Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. The CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.

* **Contract Three** is the `DeferredEquityPlan` contract which functions like a traditional company stock plan. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for a single employee.
